# Project: [Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page "Project Assignment Webpage")

The purpose of this assignment was to recreate a landing page while getting it as close as possible to a layout provided in the form of an image, which I have enclosed in the instructions folder.

This was my first time creating a webpage so at first I was a bit overwhelmed. I didn't know where to start or what to do. It even felt as though everything I learned in the last week or two I had forgotten somehow. But once I started to focus on individual sections rather than the entire page, the whole process became easier to manage. After that everything seemed to flow together.

By no means is this page perfect, but I'm proud to have finished it. I'm leaving this webpage/README here so that I can come back at a later date and use it as a metric to gauge my progress.
